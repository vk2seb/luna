class USBIsochronousInMemoryEndpoint(Elaboratable):
    """ Isochronous endpoint that presents a memory-like interface.

    Used for repeatedly streaming data to a host from a memory or memory-like interface.
    Intended to be useful as a transport for e.g. video or audio data.

    Attributes
    ----------
    interface: EndpointInterface
        Communications link to our USB core.

    bytes_in_frame: Signal(range(0, 3073)), input
        Specifies how many bytes will be transferred during this frame. If this is 0,
        a single ZLP will be emitted; for any other value one, two, or three packets
        will be generated, depending on the packet size. Latched in at the start of
        each frame.

        The maximum allowed value for this signal depends on the number of transfers
        per (micro)frame:
        - If this is a high-speed, high-throughput endpoint (descriptor indicates
          maxPacketSize > 512 and multiple transfers per microframe), then this value
          maxes out at (N * maxPacketSize), where N is the number of transfers per microframe.
        - For all other configurations, this must be <= the maximum packet size.

    address: Signal(range(0,3072)), output
        Indicates the address / offset of the byte currently being transmitted.
        Can be used to drive the ``address` lines of an asynchronous memory
    next_address: Signal(range(0,3072)), output
        Indicates the "address" / offset of the byte that should be presented
        on :attr:``value`` at the next ``usb``-clock cycle. Can be used to drive
        the ``address`` lines of a synchronous memory.
    value: Signal(8), input
        The value to be transmitted, this cycle. Can be directly tied to the read
        port of a memory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    endpoint_number: int
        The endpoint number (not address) this endpoint should respond to.
    max_packet_size: int
        The maximum packet size for this endpoint. Should match the wMaxPacketSize provided in the
        USB endpoint descriptor.

class USBIsochronousOutStreamEndpoint(Elaboratable):
    """ Endpoint interface that receives isochronous data from the host, and produces a simple data stream.

    Used for repeatedly streaming data from a host.
    Intended to be useful as a transport for e.g. video or audio data.


    Attributes
    ----------
    stream: StreamInterface, output stream
        Full-featured stream interface that carries the data we've received from the host.
        Note that this stream is *transaction* oriented; which means that First and Last indicate
        the start and end of an individual data packet. This means that short packet detection is
        the responsibility of the stream's consumer.
    interface: EndpointInterface
        Communications link to our USB device.

    Parameters
    ----------
    endpoint_number: int
        The endpoint number (not address) this endpoint should respond to.
    max_packet_size: int
        The maximum packet size for this endpoint. If this there isn't either
        `buffer_size` of, if not given, `max_packet_size * 2` space in
        the endpoint buffer, this endpoint will silently discard the extraneous data
    buffer_size: int, optional
        The total amount of data we'll keep in the buffer; typically three max-packet-sizes or more.
        Defaults to twice the maximum packet size.
